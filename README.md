Please note: I have not implemented storing ftp files on local disk
             as this is not mentioned clearly in the assignment and redundant.


1. Install dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Export `FTPUSER`, `FTPPASS` variables

```
export FTPUSER = 'ivan_petrovich'
export FTPPASS = 'superseret123'
```

3. Run code:

```
$  python3 data_pipe.py
```

4. Verify tables are populated in MySQL

5. Run queries from files `task3.sql`, `task4.sql` to complete the Task 3, 4 assignment
